# Code Style

1. Please avoid "snake code"!
2. Don't change any library versions or even the c++ version, which is c++11 at the current time. 
   If you still think there really is a reason for doing that, please contact the origin author.
3. Don't use simple "Tab" for indenting your code. Please configure your "Tab" so it would use 
   2 spaces instead.
4. If you start a new code block that usually starts with { please use a new line. Same here for
   closing a code block with }.
5. Use the right prefix for any function identifier/name. General functions do not have a prefix.
   Valid prefix identifiers are "text", "model", "timeEvent", "point", "sound", "font", "line", "video"
   and "window". If you would like to introduce a new prefix feel free to do so.
6. Please don't reorganize existing code without the authors permission.
7. If you're not sure if you're doing it the right way just have a look at existing project code. It
   should be clear by then.
